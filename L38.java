//why making the main() method as a static method?
/* 
static means the method belongs to the class itself, not to an object.

When you start a Java program (e.g., java MyClass), the JVM needs an entry point to begin execution.

At that point, no objects have been created yet ‚Äî so the JVM must call a method without needing to instantiate the class.

üîÅ What if main() were not static?
If main were not static, you‚Äôd need to create an object of your class before calling it:
But here's the catch:
‚ñ∂ To create the object, you‚Äôd need to run some code.
‚ñ∂ But that code would go‚Ä¶ inside main?
‚ñ∂ It‚Äôs a chicken-and-egg problem ‚Äî you'd need to run main to create the object, but you need the object to run main.
